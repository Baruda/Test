        iOS Tech Test
        It showcased the tech test using the below tech stack: Keep it simple(KISS), was my goal and to demonstrate my iOS expertise and experience.
        •  The app used the Object Oriented SOLID principles and display design patterns for Presentation layer, were duely observed using Observable pattern.
        •  The Clean Code Architecture, was being implemented with proper design and writing concise codebase reducing and writing any unneccesary boilerplate code that was not needed.
        •  The app was modular and showed different layers of responsibility,such as the UI Layer, Service and Network layer, Business Logic and used simple storage and persistence layer for a simple app.
        •  The SwiftUI / Combine framework were also implemented properly.
        •  Unit tests / UI tests was carried out but if changes were needed in the app, in the future or I was to add new feature and  make changing in a particular component, TDD would be carried out extensively. 
        To ensure I don't break the existing codebase and to make sure every component is working properly before deploying into production.
